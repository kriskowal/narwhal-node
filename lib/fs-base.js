'''STATUS: PROPOSAL, TRIAL IMPLEMENTATIONS'''

The "fs-base" module exports a minimal, engine-specific interface for
manipulating a file system and constructing raw byte streams.  The [[IO|IO
stream API]] is beyond the scope of this specification.  It is the intent of
this specification to provide exactly and only the components of a file system
API that cannot be implemented in pure JavaScript.  

''Pending the ratification of [[Filesystem/A]]: Implementations may opt to
provide more methods, matching the interfaces specified in [[Filesystem/A]], if
they can be implemented with better performance natively than in pure
JavaScript based on the methods specified here.''

== Types ==

Arguments used throughout this document will have the following types, unless
explicitly specified otherwise:

* '''path''' is either a String, an Object with a toString() method, or an
Object with a valueOf() method that returns an Object with a toString() method.
In the case where path is an Object, the object must return the same string for
the same path on the same system, provided the path in canonicalizable.

* '''mode''' is an Object describing the open mode for a file. Each property is
subject to a true or falsey test. Meaningful properties include read, write,
append, truncate, create, and exclusive.  ''Note: any value is equivalent to
false if the property is omitted.''

* '''permissions''' is an instance of Permissions, or a duck-type thereof.

The "fs-base" module exports the following constructors:

* '''Permissions''', a class that describes file system permissions. Instances
of Permissions are initially deep copies of all transitively owned properties
of Permissions.default and have a eponymous property for the optional
"constructor" argument of the constructor.
** Mandatory properties on all platforms are Boolean values owner.read and
owner.write. 
** Mandatory properties on UNIX platforms platforms are Boolean values
owner.{read, write, execute}, group.{read, write, execute} and other.{read,
write, execute}. 
** Permissions.default must initially reflect the current default file creation
permissions in the host environment; i.e. in a UNIX environment,
Permissions.default would reflect the inverse of umask. Where this is not
possible, compliant implementations must initialize Permissions.default to
{{owner: {read: true, write: true}}

== Files ==

; openRaw(path, mode, permissions)
: returns a raw byte stream object with the given mode and permissions from the
[[IO]] system. The details of this object are unspecified, except 
* it has a "close" method that closes any operating-system level resources
allocated by "openRaw", and 
* the garbage collector must finalize the stream by performing an equivalent
operation to the "close" method to prevent resource leaks.

"openRaw" throws an exception when "path" cannot be opened, or "path" refers to
a directory.
* "openRaw" interprets the '''mode''' object's properties as follows
** '''read''': open for reading
** '''write''': open for writing
** '''append''': open for writing: the file position is set to the end of the
file before every write. An exception is thrown when append is not used in
conjunction with write.
** '''create''': create the file if it does not exist
** '''exclusive''': used only in conjunction with create, specifies that the if
the file already exists that the open should fail. "openRaw" must implement
"exclusive" with atomic file system primitives. "openRaw" must throw an
exception when "path" is a symbolic link, and when "exclusive" is used without
"create".
** '''truncate''': used only in conjunction with "write" or "append", specifies
that if the path exists, it must be truncated (not replaced) by "openRaw".
"openRaw" must throw an exception when "truncate" is used without "write".
* When creating a file, the '''permissions''' object passed to "openRaw" is
used as the argument to the Permissions constructor. The resultant Permissions
instance is used to open this file.

/**
 * Open a file for reading.
 *
 * @param {String} path
 * @param {Object} mode optional
 * @param {Permissions || Object} permissions optional
 * @returns a raw byte stream
 *
 * The following combinations of true `read`, `write`, `update` *
 * and `append` properties are supported:
 *
 * * `read`: read only
 * * `write`: write only, truncates, creates if necessary
 * * `append`: write only, append, creates if necessary
 * * `read` and `update`: read and write, does not create, does not
 *   truncate
 * * `write` and `update`: read and write, trancates, creates if
 *   necessary
 * * `append` and `update`: read and write, does not truncate,
 *   creates if necessary
 * 
 * On some varieties of UNIX, "append" causes all writes to be
 * appended, regardless of the seek position.
 *
 * The following additional properties can be set on the
 * options and are used when the underlying system supports
 * them:
 * 
 * * `exclusive`: prevents the file from being opened if it
 *   a file already exists. Atomicity of the `exclusive` open
 *   can be used to coordinate processes like daemons.
 * * `truncate`: explicitly requests truncation of the file
 *   upon successful open.
 * * `create`: explicitly requests creation if the file
 *   does not exist.
 *
 * The following properties can also be specified but are
 * not mentioned in the CommonJS standard:
 *
 * * `xSync`: requests that data be written to disk immediately.
 * * `xNarwhalNoControlTty`: requests that, if the opened file is
 *   a terminal device or pseudo terminal, that the calling
 *   process does not become the controller for that terminal.
 * * `xNarwhalNoFollow`: ensures that symbolic links are not followed,
 *   which prevents certain kinds of attacks that take
 *   advantage of race conditions in opening files where the
 *   attacker subverts a write by injecting a symbolic link
 *   at a path that is known to be opened by a process with
 *   authority in excess of its own.
 * * `xNarwhalDirectory`

== Extended Attributes (optional) ==

Extended attribute methods may be defined on systems that may support the
feature on some volumes.  See
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes].

; getAttribute(path, key String, default ByteString) ByteString
: Gets the value of an extended attribute.  If a third argument is provided,
including undefined, and there is no corresponding extended attribute for the
requested key, the default is returned.  Otherwise, if there is no extended
attribute for the requested key, getAttribute must throw an exception. Throws a
ValueError if the volume does not support extended attributes.

; setAttribute(path, key String, value ByteString)
: Sets an extended attribute.  Throws a ValueError if the volume does not
support extended attributes.

; removeAttribute(path, key String)
: Removes the extended attribute for a given key.  If there is no corresponding
key, throws an exception. Throws a ValueError if the volume does not support
extended attributes.

; listAttributeNames(path) Array * String
: returns an Array of Strings of the keys of all extended attributes on a given
path. Throws a ValueError if the volume does not support extended attributes.

== Unicode ==

* Filesystems which are Unicode-compatible shall have their file names
seamlessly translated to and from Strings containing UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE,
depending on the native architecture.

* Filesystems which are not Unicode-compatible shall have file names
represented in JavaScript strings such that all unique filenames generate
unique Strings, and all values returned by the index() method are suitable for
use as a path.

= Notes =

* Conformant implementations working on ''path'' must not alter the permissions
of ''path'''s parent directory to complete an operation, even if altering the
permissions of the parent directory would be necessary for the operation to
succeed.
